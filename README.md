# ML-Evolutionary-Algorithm-to-solve-TSP
A Jupyter notebook solving the Traveling Salesperson Problem with the use of genetic algorithms. <br>
In this exercise, I will attempt to solve an instance of the traveling salesman problem (TSP) using different methods. <br>
The goal is to become familiar with evolutionary algorithms <br>
and compare their effectiveness with exhaustive search on a difficult search problem without the use of EA-related libraries. <br>
